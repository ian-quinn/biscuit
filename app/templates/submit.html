        <h2>Type of Contributions</h2>
        <p>BS2023 is now open for abstracts! As a platform promoting communications from both academy and industry world, BS2023 calls for research papers, project reports and workshop proposals, to best represent the latest breakthroughs in the realm of building simulation.<br>
        If you mean to make proposals such as invited speech, panel discussion or other events, please contact <a href="mailto:info@bs2023.org">info@bs2023.org</a>.</p>

All papers accepted and presented will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which are indexed by Scopes and open-accessed on IBPSA website. Top-ranked ones (regardless of the presentation type) will be awarded and proposed to top journals for further <a href="{{ url_for('publication') }}">publication</a>. Please refer to the templates when submitting your full-paper, after the abstract is accepted. </p>

It could be the report of real-world projects, the work collection of student workshops, or the simulation with actual performance data. On the acceptance of your abstract, you only need to submit an extended abstract, following the template below. We are expecting 1~2 sessions for this kind of contribution.</p>

        <h2>Presentation types</h2>
        <p>The author of the accepted research paper or project reports will be invited to present their work during BS2023. The designated types are <strong>Oral presentation</strong> and <strong>Poster presentation</strong>. Please indicate your preference when you submit an abstract.<br>
        A thorough oral presentation and in-depth discussion are indispensable for BS2023. We plan to give all intended presenters the chance to demonstrate their work in person. Depending on the number of participants, the oral presentation may take the form of full-speech, short-speak, or flash talks. The committee would best organize it on the knowledge of your preference.<br>
        The poster provides a more interactive discussion. We aim to spare stand-alone slots in the conference program to make it as effective as possible. With the low-carbon vision, the dynamic poster may have a chance to be displayed in LED kiosks.</p>
