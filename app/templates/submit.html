Some top-ranked paper (regardless of presentation types) will be transmitted to indexed journals for further <a href="{{ url_for('publication') }}">publication</a> after enrichment. The best conference paper will be <a href="{{ url_for('awards') }}">awarded</a> at the ending ceremony. </p>

The authentic data comparing the simulation and the actual operation performance is always welcome. This kind of contribution does not require the submission of a full paper but only the submission of an extended abstract. Please use the extended abstract template below. We are expecting 1~2 tracks in discussions for such practitions in industry.</p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>The buttons below will guide you to the testing systems: ConfTool and Oxford Abstract. However, all accounts and submissions will be erased at the end of the testing period. After registration to the system, you only need to submit a brief abstract of your contributions within 500 words, with title and key words. We kindly suggest that you append all information about the presenter and co-authors when submitting the abstract. The information will not be disclosed to the third party. </p>
        <p>Check out the following bullets before continue:</p>
