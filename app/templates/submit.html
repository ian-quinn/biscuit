        <h2>Presentation types</h2>
        <p>The author of the accepted research paper or project reports will be invited to present their work during BS2023. The designated types are ORAL and POSTER presentation. Please indicate your preference when you submit an abstract.<br>
        <b>ORAL</b> As BS2023 will be in a hybrid mode, the presenter may choose to give a full-length presentation either in-person or through our virtual platform (depending on the registration type). There might be a discount on the experience in trade for your utmost convenience under post-COVID policies. However, we will do our best to make it all synchronized in a seamless conference program.<br>
        <b>POSTER</b> provides a more interactive discussion. There will be poster slots in the conference program for you to discuss your project thoroughly, and social networking at the same time. With LED kiosks on site, you may use multiple media (video clip, poster or mind mapping) for demonstration. The virtual platform has the same function, and you may have a virtual round-table with the people dropping by.</p>
