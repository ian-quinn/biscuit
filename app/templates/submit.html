        <h2>Presentation Types</h2>
        <p>The author of the accepted research paper or project reports will be invited to present their work during BS2023. The designated types are ORAL and POSTER presentation. Please indicate your preference when submitting the manuscript.<br>
        <b>ORAL</b> allows the speakers a 15-20 minutes time slot to present their work during the parallel sessions. It is the most traditional and welcomed way to introduce the research thoroughly. BS2023 continues to be hybrid, but we encourage you to participate in the physical one for a better experience since all travel restrictions to China have been lifted.<br>
        <b>POSTER</b> provides a more interactive discussion. There will be poster sessions for you to dive into your research and social networking at the same time. To reach a wider audience, we will provide poster stands/kiosks on-site and on the website. All posters are expected to be attended during the poster session. It is not recommended for online attendees to choose this type of presentation. We will decide whether to use online poster sessions based on the overall preference of participants.</p>
